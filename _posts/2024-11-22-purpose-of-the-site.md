Hello! Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. This will function as a personal blog and place for me to organize my thoughts as I work through a Bachelor's in Cybersecurity at WGU.

Ideally, this will result in me having lots of articles about my schooling that I can look back on as I venture further into the field! Typing things out has always helped my memory recall, and I'm not a stranger to markdown so here's to giving this the old college try.

Have a great day, I'll write soon.
