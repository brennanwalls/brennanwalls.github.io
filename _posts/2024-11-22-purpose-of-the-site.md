Hello! Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. This will function as a personal blog and place for me to organize my thoughts as I work through a Bachelor's in Cybersecurity at WGU.

Ideally, this will result in me having lots of articles  that I can reference when I start branching out into the field after graduation. I plan on blogging about projects I'm working on and technology that I'm learning, as well as recaps on classes and certifications. Typing things out has always helped my memory recall, and my work as a sysadmin has definitely taught me how to document. Let's give blogging a try.

Have a great day, I'll write soon.
