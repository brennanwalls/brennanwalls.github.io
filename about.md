### I'm Brennan and I like FOSS.
In 2020 I moved to Chicago and got the idea to buy an old Dell server, build a data center in my closet, and learn networking. Through that experience I became obsessed with &#42;nix operating systems and the FOSS community as a whole. A lot of my time now is spent as the SysAdmin for my family's business, Polytech, while completing my Bachelors degree in Cybersecurity at WGU. I hope to take the experience I've gained on this journey and start working for a cloud-based security team in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Loop" target="_blank">Loop</a> soon.

I live to travel and I am a transit nerd who prefers bikes to cars. I currently reverse commute from the city into the suburbs via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metra" target="_blank">Metra</a> - it makes me feel like a kid. For fun I'm always looking for a new video game or book recommendation. I played in many bands during my 20s so I try to stay plugged-in to the scene by showing up to support my favorite artists often.
