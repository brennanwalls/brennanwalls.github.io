### I'm Brennan and I like FOSS.
In 2020 I moved to Chicago and got the idea to buy a decommisioned server, build a data center in my closet, and learn networking. Through that experience I became obsessed with &#42;nix operating systems and the FOSS community as a whole. A lot of my time now is spent as the system administrator for my family's business, Polytech, while completing my Bachelor degree in Cybersecurity at WGU. I hope to take my experience and start working for a cloud-based team in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Loop" target="_blank">the loop</a> after graduation.

I live to travel and I am a transit nerd who loves to ride bikes. I currently reverse commute from the city into the suburbs via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metra" target="_blank">Metra</a> - it makes me feel like a kid. I'm always looking for a new video game or book recommendation.
